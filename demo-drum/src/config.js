/**
 * Central tuning for the spherical, mechanical gravity-mix lottery machine.
 *
 * Scale note: the chamber has an inner radius of ~3.0 (≈ a real 700 mm sphere at
 * 1 unit ≈ 10 cm) and a lottery ball has radius ~0.20 (≈ 4 cm). Gravity is
 * scaled to match that unit choice so falls look natural, not floaty.
 *
 * Per-game specifics (ball counts, ranges, result layout) live in games.js —
 * this file holds only the physics/visual tunables.
