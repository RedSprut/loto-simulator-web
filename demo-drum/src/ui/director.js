/**
 * Camera director — frontal and calm. One base composition for the whole draw:
 *  • Landscape/desktop: the whole machine (drum top → tube → tray) inside the
 *    band-reserved canvas; pull back only as far as needed so nothing slips under
 *    the bottom control band.
 *  • Portrait/phone: a dedicated close composition — the drum is the dominant
 *    object, filling the full width (its empty side rim may run off-screen), the
 *    machine fills the frame vertically and the tray sits just above the button.
 *
 * The only movement is during a ball's exit: a gentle zoom IN toward the ball
 * (the subject is the BALL, not the whole drum) that eases back afterwards. Never
 * a zoom OUT. Everything here is visual — physics is never touched.
